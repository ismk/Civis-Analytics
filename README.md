Seth is a very superstitious fan of the Chicago Bears with a very specific routine he follows. Each year on the third day of football season (September 6 for 2014), and every third day thereafter for the rest of the season, Seth wears his orange Bears hat all day. On the seventh day of football season (September 10th for 2014), and on that day of the week for the rest of the season, Seth wears his blue Bears hat. On days when he would wear both hats, he doesn't wear any hat and instead wears his lucky Jay Cutler (#6) jersey. 'Gotta let the hats rest to build up the luck,' Seth says. Write a function that, given an integer representing what day of football season it is, returns a string representing what lucky Bears paraphernalia, if any Seth will wear that day.
